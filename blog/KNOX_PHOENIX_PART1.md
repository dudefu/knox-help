# Support Apache Phoenix in Apache Knox - Part 1: Installation and Configuration
The aim here is to support Apache Phoenix APIs through Apache Knox.

Phoenix enables OLTP by alowing users to query HBase (i.e. leveraging schema-on-demand)
using SQL syntax, allowing developers to re-use their knowledge of SQL.

## Acceptance Critiera
 * As a developer, allow me to proxy Apache Phoenix APIs through Apache Knox
 * As a system admin, allow me to secure access to Apache Phoenix with Apache Knox
 providing Authorization and Authentication.

# Knox A3 Architecture Overview
When trying to understanding the overall design and architecture of a new system,
I try to write down what I've learned, and distil the knowledge into a smaller,
reference style document for easy look-up.

A way I was introduced to this, on an Architecture training course at a previous
employer, was through the use of an A3 Architecture Overview (A3AO) [1].

To this end, I produced my own [Knox A3AO](/documentation/KNOX_A3AO.pdf) after studying

 * [Knox Developer's Guide](http://knox.apache.org/books/knox-0-9-1/dev-guide.html)
 * [Securing Hadoop's REST APIs Apache Knox Gateway](http://www.slideshare.net/KevinMinder/knox-hadoopsummit20140505v6pub) from Hortonworks
 * [Hadoop Security Today & Tomorrow](http://www.slideshare.net/vinnies12/hadoop-security-today-tomorrow-apache-knox/) from Hortonworks

The knowledge, and diagrams, are products of the Apache Knox project and of Hortonrworks Inc., I've merely re-packaged them for ease of comprehension.

I hope this helps.
